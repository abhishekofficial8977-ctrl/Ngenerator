N Generator - Expanded Flutter Project
=====================================

This project includes a basic working Flutter app scaffold that can:
- Create a notice via a form
- Generate a PDF (uses `pdf` package)
- Save PDF to app documents directory
- Share PDF via installed apps (WhatsApp, Email, etc.)
- Simple admin/staff login demo (local)

Important notes:
- This is a demo scaffold; for production you should add:
  - Proper authentication and backend (Firebase or server)
  - PDF protection/encryption if required (special libraries / paid SDKs)
  - Offline sync (sqflite + sync logic) and GPS tracking
  - Robust error handling and input validation

How to build APK on mobile/desktop:
1. Install Flutter SDK on a PC or use online build service (recommended).
2. From project root:
   flutter pub get
   flutter build apk --release
3. APK will be in build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/

Assets included:
- assets/logo_pragati.png
- assets/logo_northernarc.png
- assets/placeholder_client.png

If you want, I can now:
- Help you build the APK using a free online builder step-by-step
- Or guide you to run Flutter on your PC / use a cloud build
